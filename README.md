## Getting sources

Clone repository using:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/clamwin/clamav-win32.git`

## Notes

* You can store database and config paths in the registry using
  clamav.reg file (I may make a nsis installer in the future),
  paths can be also `REG_EXPAND_SZ`, environment variables are
  allowed here (i.e. you can use paths like `%HomeDrive%\ClamAV`).

* libclamunrar needs `unicows.dll` when used on Windows 9x, you can download from
  [Microsoft Layer for Unicode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4237)

## Running Clamd and FreshClam as daemon

* import `clamav.reg` file
* create `C:\ClamAV` and `C:\ClamAV\db`
* put executables in `C:\ClamAV`
* create freshclam.conf in `C:\ClamAV`
* create clamd.conf in `C:\ClamAV`
* install the service with (in Administrator cmd prompt): `clamd.exe --install`
* launch `freshclam.exe` to download the virus database

freshclam.conf

```text
DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net
DNSDatabaseInfo current.cvd.clamav.net
```

clamd.conf

```text
TCPSocket 3310
TCPAddr 127.0.0.1
MaxThreads 2
LogFile C:\ClamAV\clamd.log
DatabaseDirectory C:\ClamAV\db
```

Make sure `C:\Clamav` is writable by the `System Service` user.

Finally start the service with net start clamd
